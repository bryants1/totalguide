    "text": "I've played almost every course in the state of SC and this is always one of my favorite places to play. The course layout is great! It has a lot of holes that make you think and where to play your ball instead of just ripping the driver on every hole. Beautiful holes that are all different sizes and shapes and some elevation changes which do not exist not too far away. The course has always been in Country Club Conditions. This is great for something that is out in what most people would consider cow country. It's not overcrowded. I played behind some groups that were fairly backed up, so I was taking extra shots and worked on the short game on most greens to keep busy but still finished up in under 4 hours.",

    "text": "Got off on time. Guy in pro shop and starter were nice. Layout was nice. Seemed like par 3s were toughest holes. Water on half of holes. Plenty of traps which were ok. Course in good shape. Greens had been aerated, so a little tricky to putt. Marshall came by but there wasn\u2019t much he could do. Pace was a little slow, around 4:15 and we were a twosome waiting every hole. Concern that they apparently allow fivesomes, which could slow it down more. (Sign says no 5 somes today) Big complaint was drinking water. No fountain in pro shop. Fountains on course didn\u2019t work and no water jugs out. Happily it wasn\u2019t too hot. Would definitely play again.",

It\u2019s easy to tell that this maintenance crew knows what they are doing and the course played spectacular tee to green. Now to the problems. The staff was very rude and unprofessional. The locals had set up a party literally just a couple of yards off the 18th green and wouldn\u2019t move. We waited for a while and gestured for them to move so that we could hit , bit they wouldn\u2019t. They just became very loud and boisterous so we just picked up and left without finishing or making things worse. It was too bad because everyone was playing well and we were all within a couple of strokes apart Not being able to finish our round was very disappointing. I\u2019ll never go back here as there are so many other options.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to play this course for a while and having recently joined the GolfPASS/GolfNOW website eliminated any excuses for not giving it a try. I'm a solo player most of the time and found the course to be relaxing, quiet, fairway houses not too close, and in VERY GOOD condition. The only exception which downgraded course conditions were the active repairs of fungi damage to the greens. I was asked only once to hold my play while the groundsmen could finish up. I read some of the comments about the front desk/Club Pro not being pleasant. As it was my first time playing there I did have a few questions and often like to engage in small talk with the staff. This gentleman made me feel like I was a bother and couldn't wait to get my cart and get as far away from the Pro Shop as possible.",

Fairway grass was dormant but well cut, rough was dormant and cut just enough to make finding the short grass meaningful. Between loose leave and light brown rough , balls in the rough were sometimes hard to find. Green were in good shape, rolled true and were on the fast side. Staff was very friendly.. Thoroughly enjoyed the round. This is a course that I want to go back to when things are green and growing.",

Very much enjoyed the course, even though it was a bit wet, however it would be nice if they gave the ladies something more than 85-100 yards on a par 3, and leveling the red tee boxes would be nice as well. Also didn't encounter very much southern hospitality from the gentleman in the pro shop, and we also did not like being sold cold hotdogs after the 9th, and right at lunch hour.... but the course is worth playing.",

We live on the boarder of NC/SC, we went to a course that's close to us in SC. As we were approaching the course we saw bout 10 carts in line at the first tee, we knew we had to go somewhere else. We found Wyboo!!! Even though it was it took us a ride to get there, we didn't mind because it was a course we hadn't play before. At first, it looked like any other golf course. The guy inside was nice and friendly. He told us after we paid we could go off at when we were ready. Looked like they had plenty of rain seen a few puddles in a couple of fairways but it did affect play. A very nice layout from start to finish. The par 5s are long, have to be very carful where you hit your ball too. Hit what i thought was a perfect drive. Was in the fairway looking for my ball could not find it at all, the way it was turning to go to fairway was a pond right there. OUCH!!!! Everything is just wonderful about this course. It is a must play if you are in the area. Think we will be back before the summer is over.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed this course. We made the 75 mile trip from Charleston I-26/I-95 for an 8:53 tee time. We arrived about an hour ahead and the staff allowed us to immediately get out ahead of 2 foursomes. That made for a great day without any waiting. The fairways were well maintained with very few tight lies. The rough was well maintained and cut a little shorter than most courses we play. A fairly flat course provided for mostly even lies. The greens rolled true and were about an 8. Most were side protected but offered wide approaches. Average number of doglegs but most were drivable. Some lateral water that was avoidable with well placed drives. The bunkers were soft and well maintained. We managed to get in 27 holes and our scoring went way down on the last 9. It might have simply been the day of the week but we felt as if we had the entire course to ourselves. I\u2019m not suggesting the course is without challenge but there is enough forgiveness that it is well suited to all levels of ability. One thing I did find unusual was their no walking at any time policy. That goes for members as well. The cart paths are concrete and there are a number of areas that could use some attention. The carts are reliable but showing some age and wear I suspect as a result of that no walking policy. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our round and will certainly plan another trip.",

Fairways and greens were in great shape and roughs were OK, as they are coming out of dormancy. We were probably 4 of a couple dozen on the course, and pace of play was quick. Definitely a no-frills experience and that's exactly what we needed. Took advantage of the replay deal with our package and played another 18. Wyboo is definitely not one to miss. Kudos to the grounds crew for keeping things playable through the winter, I'm sure the spring and summer will be top notch.",

    "text": "This was my first time playing Wyboo and to be honest, I wasn't expecting much for a $9.00 round of golf. The greens had been aerated a couple of months before we played so again, I wasn't expecting anything great...but for such a cheap price I thought, what the heck. We arrived a bit late but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. There was an issue with the address listed on the GolfNow App and the actual physical address of the course. The staff was totally understanding and had no problem with us going off a bit late. The course was in phenomenal shape! The greens were decent considering the recent aeration. Every putt was mostly straight but the greens were definitely still playable. It was challenging enough for an average golfer, but not too challenging where you could lose a ball every hole. I'd love to come back when the greens were perfect to get a better idea of the actual quality of play. The course is located a bit far away from any city life, but that made for a quick paced round and an overall enjoyable experience. Honestly, I would have had no problem paying $20-$30 to play this course, even with the condition of the greens. If you get a deal on a discount app, take it! You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "I highly recommend this course. I played the course in early Sept 2016, and it was in excellent condition. Tee boxes and greens were well kept, and the fairways were exceptional. The course was not overly challenging, but not easy either. Bunkers in play on every whole, both fairway and around the greens. Not much water, but it is in play on a few holes. Fairways on the wider end, lots of sharp dog legs. Thick rough around the greens. I suspect one of the reasons that the course is in such great condition is that its in the middle of no where, and so my guess is it doesn't get a ton of traffic. I played on a nice day in early Sept, arrived a little before noon, jumped right on as a single and didn't have anyone behind me the entire round (and this was on a nice later summer day). The lack of crowd is definitely a positive in my book. Also, the price I paid for the round was just ridiculous. $10 for greens fees and a cart, and the course was in a condition that I would say is easily on par with many country clubs/ private courses. Steal of a deal. To sum it up, I was very impressed with this course. Its worth a bit of a drive, and I look forward to playing it again soon.",

    "text": "My wife and I played this course and found it challenging, interesting and offered a fair advantage on the various tee boxes, very nice. The layout allowed one to push it hard off the tee if you desire a little risk or play to a spot for safety. We enjoyed the play on Independence day for a mid-morning round on a day in the upper 90's. There was drinking water on the course and simple snacks and sandwiches in the snack bar. The practice facility was first class, the course is well marked and maintained. The big drawback for us was that they had just aeriated the greens recently so putting was a little rough, but all in all we enjoyed this very quiet good pace of play course. It was worth a bit of a drive to get there, try it you will like it.",

To begin the round, the other 3 in my group showed up late, we got off after I spoke with the two groups that were waiting and due to tee off after us. They were very courteous and understanding. On the course, from tee box to green, the course played well and was well maintained. Most Greens rolled true, but a divots were not repaired on a few. The only con I have for the round is that the pace of play was a little slow due to 1, the group I played with (2 were beginners) and 2, the amount of groups out on the course. There were a few challenging holes from the white tees, but will play the blues next time to challenging myself. Overall, I loved the course condition.",

The course has generously landing areas. I hit mostly driver with two 3-woods off the tee. The par 3s vary in length. The bunkers had a variety of soft and firm sand. Pace of play was fine on a Sat mid-day, finishing in 3:45'. I really enjoy flatter lay outs like Wyboo, and look forward to returning.",

The course was very well maintained and the pace of play was better than most, especially considering that we played on a holiday weekend. The greens were a bit slower than average but were in very good condition. This is NOT a pumpkin patch golf course... it would fit in beautifully in any setting in the Charleston area. But then the cost to play would go up signifcantly! Do yourself and your wallet a favor. Get three golf buddies and make the trip to Wyboo. I'm sure you'll be impressed with the quality of the course and the great value!",

First 18 flew by, no one else around - peaceful on many holes, no homes, felt like it was just us out there. Condition of course is very good, winter rye in the fairways looked great (some soggy areas here and there), greens rolled very nicely and firm (very few divot marks), other areas around greens are worn down from cart traffic - guessing some people just drive where they like. Second 18 ran into delays starting on #3 and stayed that way, so much for etiquette allowing faster players through. Would like to do it again providing it's another \"All U Can Play\" deal, otherwise catch a round when traveling down 95.",

The tee's were over seeded, the fairways dormant and the greens had been dyed for the winter. When we played the weather was mostly clear, in the 50's and light wind so \"perfect\" for South Carolina and December.

They obviously started on back nine which apparently management allowed. Why call for tee times when you can not play through at the turn in the order you started the round? Course was not in very good shape overall.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nPoor\nCourse Conditions:\nFair\nStaff Friendliness:\nFair\nValue for the Money:\nFair\nOff-Course Amenities:\nn/a\nCourse Difficulty:\nn/a\n\ntykelee\n\nGreat find\n\n11/05/2023 - Verified Purchase\n\nHandicap: n/a Plays: A few times a week\n\n Recommend\n\nThis hidden gem is well worth the short ride from I-95 The course was well maintained Wwth a pretty and fair layout using four different tee boxes.

The course layout is great! It has a lot of holes that make you think and where to play your ball instead of just ripping the driver on every hole. Beautiful holes that are all different sizes and shapes and some elevation changes which do not exist not too far away. The course has always been in Country Club Conditions. This is great for something that is out in what most people would consider cow country. It's not overcrowded. I played behind some groups that were fairly backed up, so I was taking extra shots and worked on the short game on most greens to keep busy but still finished up in under 4 hours.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nExcellent\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nExcellent\nCourse Difficulty:\nSomewhat Challenging",

The greens are mint, light undulations not to small, and 90% pure throughout. Grass range, so you can actually warm up!! Open enough that all the twists and turns don't equal 20 lost balls if u play aggressive.

Guy in pro shop and starter were nice. Layout was nice. Seemed like par 3s were toughest holes. Water on half of holes. Plenty of traps which were ok. Course in good shape. Greens had been aerated, so a little tricky to putt. Marshall came by but there wasn\u2019t much he could do. Pace was a little slow, around 4:15 and we were a twosome waiting every hole. Concern that they apparently allow fivesomes, which could slow it down more. (Sign says no 5 somes today) Big complaint was drinking water. No fountain in pro shop. Fountains on course didn\u2019t work and no water jugs out. Happily it wasn\u2019t too hot. Would definitely play again.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nAverage\nCourse Conditions:\nGood\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nAverage\nCourse Difficulty:\nn/a\n\nu314163771043",

Having played some big name courses in South Carolina, playing Wyboo was enjoyable. Some well designed holes that kept the round interesting. The greens were excellent and even though we had a splash of rain, the greens could take the moisture and putted perfectly.

This is a very nice course in great shape. It\u2019s easy to tell that this maintenance crew knows what they are doing and the course played spectacular tee to green. Now to the problems. The staff was very rude and unprofessional. The locals had set up a party literally just a couple of yards off the 18th green and wouldn\u2019t move. We waited for a while and gestured for them to move so that we could hit , bit they wouldn\u2019t. They just became very loud and boisterous so we just picked up and left without finishing or making things worse. It was too bad because everyone was playing well and we were all within a couple of strokes apart Not being able to finish our round was very disappointing. I\u2019ll never go back here as there are so many other options.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nPoor\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nPoor\nValue for the Money:\nFair\nOff-Course Amenities:\nPoor\nCourse Difficulty:\nn/a",

We play it frequently. Today was incredibly frustrating. During our round as a foursome we had to let 5 twosomes play through. Don\u2019t understand why when the course is that busy they didn\u2019t put groups together to make foursomes.

Fairway grass was dormant but well cut, rough was dormant and cut just enough to make finding the short grass meaningful. Between loose leave and light brown rough , balls in the rough were sometimes hard to find. Green were in good shape, rolled true and were on the fast side. Staff was very friendly.. Thoroughly enjoyed the round. This is a course that I want to go back to when things are green and growing.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nGood\nCourse Conditions:\nGood\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nExcellent\nCourse Difficulty:\nModerate",

MOST of the bunkers are in good shape, but there are some that took a hit from Hurricane Michael which will take some time to fix. Greens rolled well with no real imperfections to speak of. Clubhouse is no frills, which is perfect. Took advantage of the replay opportunity and played another 18.

We liked the conditioning and layout so much that we went back to Wyboo in our short, four-day trip. We played another course on our last day, but felt that Wyboo was soooooo much better that we left after just one round (we normally play 2-3 rounds on the same course) and went back to Wyboo.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nExcellent\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nn/a\nOff-Course Amenities:\nn/a\nCourse Difficulty:\nSomewhat Challenging\n\nSHONNE5477713\n\nA Grate time at Wyboo at Deer Creak\n\n06/16/2018 - Verified Purchase\n\nHandicap: n/a Plays: Once a week\n\n Recommend\n\nMy golf partner and I have been playing everywhere over the last 10 plus years. We luck up & find some great courses and sometimes not so great courses. We live on the boarder of NC/SC, we went to a course that's close to us in SC. As we were approaching the course we saw bout 10 carts in line at the first tee, we knew we had to go somewhere else. We found Wyboo!!! Even though it was it took us a ride to get there, we didn't mind because it was a course we hadn't play before. At first, it looked like any other golf course. The guy inside was nice and friendly. He told us after we paid we could go off at when we were ready. Looked like they had plenty of rain seen a few puddles in a couple of fairways but it did affect play. A very nice layout from start to finish. The par 5s are long, have to be very carful where you hit your ball too. Hit what i thought was a perfect drive. Was in the fairway looking for my ball could not find it at all, the way it was turning to go to fairway was a pond right there. OUCH!!!! Everything is just wonderful about this course. It is a must play if you are in the area. Think we will be back before the summer is over.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nGood\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nGood\nCourse Difficulty:\nn/a\n\nu9854211\n\nVery nice course\n\n06/06/2018 - Verified Purchase\n\nHandicap: n/a Plays: A few times a week\n\n Recommend\n\nReally enjoyed this course. We made the 75 mile trip from Charleston I-26/I-95 for an 8:53 tee time. We arrived about an hour ahead and the staff allowed us to immediately get out ahead of 2 foursomes. That made for a great day without any waiting. The fairways were well maintained with very few tight lies. The rough was well maintained and cut a little shorter than most courses we play. A fairly flat course provided for mostly even lies. The greens rolled true and were about an 8. Most were side protected but offered wide approaches. Average number of doglegs but most were drivable. Some lateral water that was avoidable with well placed drives. The bunkers were soft and well maintained. We managed to get in 27 holes and our scoring went way down on the last 9. It might have simply been the day of the week but we felt as if we had the entire course to ourselves. I\u2019m not suggesting the course is without challenge but there is enough forgiveness that it is well suited to all levels of ability. One thing I did find unusual was their no walking at any time policy. That goes for members as well. The cart paths are concrete and there are a number of areas that could use some attention. The carts are reliable but showing some age and wear I suspect as a result of that no walking policy. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our round and will certainly plan another trip.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nExcellent\nCourse Conditions:\nGood\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nFair\nCourse Difficulty:\nn/a\n\nu299734780\n\nGreat Course\n\n04/27/2018\n\nHandicap: 15-19 Plays: A few times a week\n\n Recommend\n\nThis is a hidden gem. To me, this is the nicest course I have ever played. But the only way I can play Wyboo is if I book it through GolfNow or TeeOff.com. On a pastors salary, I can't pay full price. Playing golf is such a great stress relief for me as a pastor. Thankful for the opportunity to have played Wyboo now for the 5th time.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nGood\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nGood\nOff-Course Amenities:\nExcellent\nCourse Difficulty:\nSomewhat Challenging\n\nkg70041\n\nAdding Wyboo to the Rotation\n\n04/22/2018\n\nHandicap: 5-9 Plays: Once a month\n\n Recommend\n\nHave been coming to Santee for a couple years now on an annual golf trip and were pleasantly surprised by Wyboo. Fairways and greens were in great shape and roughs were OK, as they are coming out of dormancy. We were probably 4 of a couple dozen on the course, and pace of play was quick. Definitely a no-frills experience and that's exactly what we needed. Took advantage of the replay deal with our package and played another 18. Wyboo is definitely not one to miss. Kudos to the grounds crew for keeping things playable through the winter, I'm sure the spring and summer will be top notch.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nExcellent\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nExcellent\nCourse Difficulty:\nModerate\n\nu299734780\n\nMost beautiful course I have ever played\n\n04/17/2018 - Verified Purchase\n\nHandicap: 15-19 Plays: A few times a week\n\n Recommend\n\nWyboo is the best course for the money that I have been on.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nExcellent\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nExcellent\nCourse Difficulty:\nSomewhat Challenging\n\nmikemccullough7777\n\nNice Course\n\n04/06/2018\n\nHandicap: n/a Plays: A few times a week\n\n Recommend\n\nThis course was a great surprise.Great layout and in good shape for the time of year.Pacewas average but still okay.Would definitely play again and highly recommend.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nGood\nCourse Conditions:\nGood\nStaff Friendliness:\nGood\nValue for the Money:\nGood\nOff-Course Amenities:\nAverage\nCourse Difficulty:\nn/a",

The greens had been aerated a couple of months before we played so again, I wasn't expecting anything great...but for such a cheap price I thought, what the heck. We arrived a bit late but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. There was an issue with the address listed on the GolfNow App and the actual physical address of the course. The staff was totally understanding and had no problem with us going off a bit late. The course was in phenomenal shape! The greens were decent considering the recent aeration. Every putt was mostly straight but the greens were definitely still playable. It was challenging enough for an average golfer, but not too challenging where you could lose a ball every hole. I'd love to come back when the greens were perfect to get a better idea of the actual quality of play. The course is located a bit far away from any city life, but that made for a quick paced round and an overall enjoyable experience.

It's in the Top 3 of the courses I have played in the area. Very little undulation on the greens makes it easier for armatures, but layout makes if challenging for good golfers.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nGood\nCourse Conditions:\nGood\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nAverage\nCourse Difficulty:\nFairly Easy\n\nzuschlagzd\n\nHighly Recommend\n\n09/10/2016\n\nHandicap: n/a Plays: Once a month\n\n Recommend\n\nI highly recommend this course. I played the course in early Sept 2016, and it was in excellent condition. Tee boxes and greens were well kept, and the fairways were exceptional. The course was not overly challenging, but not easy either. Bunkers in play on every whole, both fairway and around the greens. Not much water, but it is in play on a few holes. Fairways on the wider end, lots of sharp dog legs. Thick rough around the greens. I suspect one of the reasons that the course is in such great condition is that its in the middle of no where, and so my guess is it doesn't get a ton of traffic. I played on a nice day in early Sept, arrived a little before noon, jumped right on as a single and didn't have anyone behind me the entire round (and this was on a nice later summer day). The lack of crowd is definitely a positive in my book. Also, the price I paid for the round was just ridiculous. $10 for greens fees and a cart, and the course was in a condition that I would say is easily on par with many country clubs/ private courses. Steal of a deal. To sum it up, I was very impressed with this course. Its worth a bit of a drive, and I look forward to playing it again soon.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nGood\nCourse Conditions:\nExcellent\nStaff Friendliness:\nExcellent\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nGood\nCourse Difficulty:\nModerate\n\njbleau\n\nWyboo is remote but WY Not!\n\n07/04/2016\n\nHandicap: 10-14 Plays: A few times a week\n\n Recommend\n\nMy wife and I played this course and found it challenging, interesting and offered a fair advantage on the various tee boxes, very nice. The layout allowed one to push it hard off the tee if you desire a little risk or play to a spot for safety. We enjoyed the play on Independence day for a mid-morning round on a day in the upper 90's. There was drinking water on the course and simple snacks and sandwiches in the snack bar. The practice facility was first class, the course is well marked and maintained. The big drawback for us was that they had just aeriated the greens recently so putting was a little rough, but all in all we enjoyed this very quiet good pace of play course. It was worth a bit of a drive to get there, try it you will like it.\n\nComment\n\n18 Hole Pace of Play:\nExcellent\nCourse Conditions:\nGood\nStaff Friendliness:\nGood\nValue for the Money:\nExcellent\nOff-Course Amenities:\nGood\nCourse Difficulty:\nModerate\nShow more reviews",
